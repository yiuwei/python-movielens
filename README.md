# MovieLens Analysis with Python 

This project will use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform data analysis through identifying popular movies, finding trending tags, and understanding user preferences. This study will go deeper into the dataset, exploring various aspects, including user ratings, movie genres, and time-series patterns. The dataset consists of six files providing data on movies, links, tags, and ratings. The Jupyter Notebook is used for data cleaning and processing before converting them into visualizations. Lastly, leveraging these data analysis tools can help uncover patterns and contribute to improving the overall movie recommendation experience for users.
